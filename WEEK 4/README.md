## Week 4 Report

### This Weeks Goals
- [ ] Figure Out Data Situation
  - [MedPAR](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/files-for-order/limited-data-set-lds-files/medpar-limited-data-set-lds-hospital-national)
    - Pros: Contains near all the data we need, would just limit our scope but not to harshly
    - Cons: For what we need and request through ResDAC, it should be free to my knowledge but con is the request process. 
  - [HCUP's National Readmission Database](https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/nrdoverview.jsp)
    - Pros: Contains all the data we would need
    - Cons: Costs $200 but quicker getting time
  - [HBioStat's Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/880/support2)
  - Potential for Synthetic Data ([Synthea](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/))
    - Pros: Could be formated to contain all the data we would need if we did have the real data
    - Cons: Findings would represent a real population distribution or cases. 
- [ ] Finalize Problem Statment Once We Have Data
- [ ] Work On Finding Articles Related To Overall Topic with a Focus on ROI Reference to determine gain Medicare Advantage plans would have if they implemented our project.
- [ ] Finalize Overall Plan for Project

### Next Steps
- 

### Challenges
- Getting the data we need without going broke

##__New Timeline:__
- Feb. 7- Present datsets that will be used and work on literature review for paper
- Feb. 13- Preprocessing: Gather and prepare the Medicare Advantage claims data by identifying relevant datasets, cleaning inconsistencies, and curating variables needed for the analysis.
- Feb. 21- EDA, Methods and Results: Include identifying high-risk conditions for readmissions, determining significant risk factors, and quantifying their impact.
- **Feb.25- PRESENTATION: clean dataset, and visualizations to work with**
- March 3- Work on any revision and feedback from the presentation
- March 14- Formulate Solutions: For the most significant high-risk conditions, we will propose interventions targeting the identified risk factors, focusing on improving patient outcomes and reducing costs
- March 28- Finalization: Report will be prepared, documenting the analysis process, findings, proposed strategies, and expected impact on readmissions and costs.
- **April 29- PRESENTATION**
